To Answer This Question Let Us Understand First What Is Language in Common?
	Language is a tool to express our thoughts, to communicate with other people, to get help from others or to help others we need to
	//**The first point is correct, language is way to express our thoughts.
	interact with other people. So in the beginning there must be some sign language to communicate. Then the sign language could have
	evolved into speaking language. I think computer programming language also same like that only.
	//**Computer Programming language is precise, it is not ambigious, it has to be accurate. We use 010 to communicate in the micro-processor.
So What Is Computer?

	It is a machine like other machines (washing machine, Grinder, Fan, Fridge). what machines can do? it helps to reduce the manpower,
	//Okay, try defining machine here. Machine does help us to reduce work. Good point.

	to solve the real time problem, to reduce the complexity of the work.


	likewise, computer machine is reducing the complexity of the work.
	let’s take calculator, what calculator is doing? if there is small problem then it is easy to solve by our own. what if the problem is
	bigger? how can we add or subtract or multiply finance details for a mega company. shall we do everything manually? NO, because
	it will take so much of time to solve the problem.
	I am giving you an insight to understand the computer machine. computer machine has a multiple software or you can say programs,
	features, services to reduce the complexity of the work.
Why We Need to Interact with The Computer?
	As I said before to interact with the computer machine to do some work we need to communicate with the machine. Can machine
	understand our speaking language? No. So how to make the machine to understand our needs? here comes the programming languages.
	programming languages helps to interact with the machines and programming languages give instructions/orders to machine to do a work.
	Does machine understand programming language? yes partially! there will be compiler in each computer machine. This compiler will
	convert the 'PROGRAM' into ‘BINARY CODE' which is the machine understandable code.
Thousands of different programming languages have been created.
Example:
•	C
•	C++
•	JAVA
•	Python
•	PHP
//**Try defining data structure in your own words, please.
//**What do you mean by data values in the below?

<<<<<<< HEAD
In computer science, a data structure is a data organization, management and storage format that enables efficient access and modification.
More precisely, a data structure is a collection of data values, the relationships among them, and the functions or operations
that can be applied to the data.
=======
Why do I need to know about Data-Structure?
	when working with data and application we need to know how the data is connected with the application, how the data is being 
	stored,manipulated,how the data flows within the application i.e structure of data.
	For example assume there is a hospital management application. when new patients come their details will be stored in the database.
	once the data is stored the hospital can use it for multi-purpose.
	In computer science, a data structure is a data organization, management and storage format that enables efficient access and modification. 
	More precisely, a data structure is a collection of data values, the relationships among them, and the functions or operations 
	that can be applied to the data.
	
	 I will, in fact, claim that the difference between a bad programmer and a good one is whether he considers his code or his 
	 data structures more important." - Linus Torvalds
	 
	 Data structures and algorithms are patterns for solving problems.You'll understand, in depth, how your computer gets things 
	 done. This informs any technical decisions you make, regardless of whether or not you're using a given algorithm directly. 
	 Everything from memory allocation in the depths of your operating system, to the inner workings of your RDBMS to how your 
	 networking stack manages to send data from one corner of Earth to another. All computers rely on fundamental data structures 
	 and algorithms, so understanding them better makes you understand the computer better.
