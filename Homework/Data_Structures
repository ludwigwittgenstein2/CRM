what is data type?
It is way to classify the type of data (i.e integer, strings) which determines the values that can be used with the corresponding type of data.
  There are two types of data,
    -Built in data type
    -Derived Data type

Built in Data type 
those data types for which a language has built in support are known as built in data types.
  -Integers
  -String
  -Float

Derived Data typeThose data types which are implementation independent as they can be implemented in one or the other way are known as derived 
data types. These data types are normally built by the combination of primary or built-in data types and associated operations on them. For 
example âˆ’

    List
    Array
    Stack
    Queue

Array
Array is a container which holds a fixed number of  items should be a same type. (ex : 1 litre water bottle is a container which holds 1 litre 
of water )
elements
