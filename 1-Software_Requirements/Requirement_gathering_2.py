The CRM market is flooded with many applications. We want to aim to do our best in this. The rise of
SaaS has turned software industry into a booming business. There are many issues within SaaS.
However -- the industry is not like manufacturing or airline industry.

The is no perfect software, yet we want software to be flexible to meet the needs of many.

User problems of Software:
Too complex
Too many features
Unintuitive
Bugs
Takes too long to wait
Many screens, When we are shifting to many tabs in browsing, our attention loses from
the content.

Computer Science problems of Software:
Scaling the software
Response rate, optimization
Complexity

When I was in Orlando, Florida. I got 50 emails a day. I could not manage them. I felt
frustrated, anxious and wanted to burn my email box. I even deleted all emails sent from
CRU. I just did not know how to?

But I knew who would hold the solution for it. It was the President of Cru's assistant.
I met him for coffee. I badly wanted to learn his skill. He didn't know me but I was comfortable
meeting new people and becoming friends every-day. I showed him my problem. My email box was flooded,
I wanted to yell and scream at CRU for sending me automation emails. He showed how he labeled the President's email.

In three months, I learnt that skill and I felt extremely happy. I thanked him so much.

The Software is there but I did not know how to use it efficiently? It took few months to learn basics of
organizing an email.
